## Software
Download the following from the JBoss Customer Portal:

 * JBoss Data Virtualization (jboss-dv-installer-6.1.0.redhat-3.jar). Note that this contains an EAP instance already.


If running under the DV EAP instance, then download:
 * Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0 (jboss-a-mq-6.2.0.redhat-133.zip)
 
If running under Fuse, then download: 
 * JBoss Fuse (jboss-fuse-full-6.1.1.redhat-412.zip)

and copy to this directory for the run.sh script to work.

Ensure that the jar file is executable by running:

    $ chmod +x <path-to-project>/software/*.jar
